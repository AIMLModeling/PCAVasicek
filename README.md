The Vasicek model is a mathematical model describing the evolution of interest rates. I explained how to use principal component analysis (PCA) for the interest rate models. I demonstrated how to calibrate Vasiceck model and how to run Monte Carlo simulations for Vasicek model.  https://youtu.be/TrEnSQ2Pms4
